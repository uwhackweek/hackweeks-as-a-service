## Community Lead
The Community Lead guides the activities of community members engaged in hackweek organization and execution. This is typically the person who contacted eScience requesting a hackweek.

Depending on the structure of the event, this role may be filled by a member of the eScience Institute core team, or by a community member looking to lead their own hackweek. In either case, the scope of the goals and activities below remains the same.

### Goals
- Matching the technical and scientific needs of the community to the design of the hackweek.
- Ensuring everyone involved is sufficiently resourced to carry out the work.
- Strategizing on how best to implement practices of open-source science within this community.
- Building supportive partnerships and communities of practice before, during, and after the hackweek.

### Specific Activities
- Acquire funding to support hackweek activities.
- Work with the community to define the overarching goals of the hackweek.
- Build a diverse, inclusive, and equitable hackweek organizing team; recruit broadly for organizers and participants.
- Help organize and attend event planning meetings.
- Review tutorial content, evaluating meeting hackweek goals, learning objectives, and community relevance.
- Attend the hackweek and be available to assist with project and tutorial work.
- Facilitate and/or lead longer-term community efforts to build on collaborations fostered around the hackweek.
