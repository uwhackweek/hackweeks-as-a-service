## What to expect as a tutorial lead

Hackweeks have traditionally been very dynamic events at which knowledge is exchanged in multiple directions across different levels of career position and backgrounds. We hope you will have an opportunity to learn a lot of new things by engaging in this experience.

Past tutorial leads have used these events to gain teaching experience and as a way to round out their teaching profile. Like other participants you can also expect to build new contacts in the community, recruit students and generate new project ideas.

In crafting a tutorial you'll gain valuable experience with creating reproducible computation examples. And together we'll collaborate on building digital content that will serve as a public resource with a citable DOI so that all tutorial authors receive credit for the effort!

## Badge
