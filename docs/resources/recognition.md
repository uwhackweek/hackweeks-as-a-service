# Recognizing Contributions

There are a variety of ways that we would like to recognize community contributions to hackweeks. 

## Website Presence

We invite all people who join us in organizing and hosting a hackweek to be included in our "Meet the team" section of each hackweek website. 

We use this YAML markdown template for each team member. 

```
- title: 
  avatar: 
  role: 
  organizations:
  - name: 
    url: 
  - name: 
  bio: 
  expertise:
  - 
  - 
  social:
  - icon: github
    icon_pack: fab
    link: 
  user_groups:
  - 
  ```
 Here is an example of how the text you include in this template gets rendered on the website:

  ```{image} ../images/website-bio.jpg
:alt: example of how to fill out website bio
:width: 1100px
:align: center
```

**Notes:**
- You must precisely follow the indentation and spacing layout shown here, so that the website correctly interprets the YAML format.
- We encourage everyone to use their GitHub avatar as the source of their personal photograph.
- Provide your GitHub username, together with the full url, for the `link` key under `social`.
- Acceptable user groups (roles) can be found [here](https://uwhackweek.github.io/hackweeks-as-a-service/services/index.html).

### Uploading to the website

To include your content on the website, please make a pull request to the `team.yaml` file located in the website for the event you're involved with. For example, here is the [file for the ICESat-2 2022 hackweek](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/website2022/blob/main/book/team.yaml). 

## Online Tutorials

All of our tutorials are recorded and shared on the [eScience Institute's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/UWeScienceInstitute/playlists). We encourage tutorial leads to link to these videos from their social media accounts and websites as a way to demonstrate their teaching competencies.

## Referrals and Feedback

The eScience Institute's hackweek as a service program will provide references for past organizers upon request. We will also offer feedback to help promote your professional development. [Contact us](mailto:arendta@uw.edu) for more information.
