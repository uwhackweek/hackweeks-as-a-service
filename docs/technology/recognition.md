# Recognizing Contributions

There are a variety of ways that we would like to recognize community contributions to hackweeks. 

## Website Presence

We invite all people who join us in organizing and hosting a hackweek to be included in our "Meet the team" section of each hackweek website. 

We use this YAML markdown template for each team member. 

```
- title: 
  avatar: 
  role: 
  organizations:
  - name: 
    url: 
  - name: 
  bio: 
  expertise:
  - 
  - 
  social:
  - icon: github
    icon_pack: fab
    link: 
  user_groups:
  - 
  ```
 Here is an example of how the text you include in this template gets rendered on the website:

  ```{image} ../images/website-bio.jpg
:alt: example of how to fill out website bio
:width: 1100px
:align: center
```

**Notes:**
```{warning}
You must precisely follow the indentation and spacing layout shown here, so that the website correctly interprets the YAML format. Copying and existing team member's text and editing is an easy way to guarantee this
```
- We encourage everyone to use their GitHub avatar as the source of their personal photograph.
- Provide your GitHub username, together with the full url, for the `link` key under `social`.
- Acceptable user groups (roles) can be found [here](https://uwhackweek.github.io/hackweeks-as-a-service/services/index.html).

### Uploading to the website

To include your content on the website, please make a pull request to the `team.yaml` file located in the website for the event you're involved with. For example, here is the [file for the ICESat-2 2022 hackweek](https://github.com/ICESAT-2HackWeek/website2022/blob/main/book/team.yaml). 

When you are just editing text, using GitHub's online text editor is very convenient:

It's best practice to create [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) from 'feature' branches. So commit your changes on a branch other than the 'main' branch:

## Online Tutorials

All of our tutorials are recorded and shared on the [eScience Institute's youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/UWeScienceInstitute/playlists). We encourage tutorial leads to link to these videos from their social media accounts and websites as a way to demonstrate their teaching competencies.

## Referrals and Feedback

The eScience Institute's hackweek as a service program will provide references for past organizers upon request. We will also offer feedback to help promote your professional development. [Contact us](mailto:arendta@uw.edu) for more information.
