* practice facilitating small group team dynamics to ensure participants feel like they are contributing
* be familiar with our suite of project [learning technologies](../technology/index.md)

Mentorship at a hackathon should be more than just occasional support. It should include taking ownership of the project, setting achievable goals, building social ties, and receiving learning-oriented support {cite:p}`nolte_how_2020`.
