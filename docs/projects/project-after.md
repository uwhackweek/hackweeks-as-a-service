# After the hackweek

We aspire to keep projects going after the hackweek! This is an optional (yet ideal) outcome of hackweek project work.

* Project leads/helpers will transition to longer-term engagement via mentorship role (optional/with support)
* Additional people join a growing **Community of Practice** (for example, centered on a community software library)
* Software, research results are packaged and shared/published
