  publication-quality books and documents from computational material.

[JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io)
  JupyterHub allows you to deploy an application that provides remote data science environments (typically Jupyter Lab) to multiple users. It can be deployed with a cloud service provider, or on your own hardware.

[JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io)
  JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter
  intended to replace the JupyterNotebook interface.

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyterbook.org)
  open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that

  meant for technical documentation and publishing. It is used by Jupyter Book and Myst tools.

[Slack](https://slack.com)
  A communication platform that we use to share information. We use separate channels
