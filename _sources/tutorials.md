# Tutorials

The purpose of this page is to provide detailed information on the activities, roles and responsibilities of hackweek tutorial leads. We draw this information from our [publication on hackweeks](http://www.pnas.org/content/115/36/8872.short).

## Roles and Responsibilities

Hackweeks are an experimental educational model that aim to build community, provide instruction, demonstrate open source practices and provide a forum for open-ended project work among a diverse group of participants. Hackweeks are neither summer schools, where an expert delivers knowledge to a room of beginners, nor a hackathon, in which people assemble in an unstrctured way and write code together. We try to occupy a space that blends these two approaches. 

What does this mean from the perspective of a tutorial lead? We invite you to design your tutorials with the following considerations in mind:

* try for content that is broad in scope and gives an initial picture of what might be possible when applying a particular data science tool. Save detailed explanations on a narrow topic for a later breakout session.
* start with simple explanations that attend to people who are seeing this content for the first time, AND keep advanced participants engaged by inviting them to assist others, or to explore more advanced concepts through individual study.
* make your tutorials interactive through live coding challenges, working through a Juypter Notebook together, or interactive discussions. Leave some space when you are not talking for people to work through examples and ask questions. 
* prepare your tutorials well in advance and practice them in front of a sample audience. We are available to help review your tutorials and provide advice on conent and delivery. 
* take a bit of time to review tutorials offered at our previous hackweeks. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMJ1ZO48cwU) is an example of a particularly well-crafted tutorial by Catherine Kuhn at our 2018 geohackweek.

Regarding deadlines, we ask all tutorial leads to have a draft tutorial prepared one month in advance of the event. This is essential so that we can configure our computing services with the libraries and datasets you need for the tutorial to run smoothly. 

## What can I expect to gain from this experience?

Hackweeks have traditionally been very dynamic events at which knowledge is exchanged in multiple directions across different levels of career position and backgrounds. We hope you will have an opportunity to learn a lot of new things by engaging in this experience. Past tutorial leads have used these events to gain teaching experience and as a way to round out their teaching profile. Like other participants you can also expect to build new contacts in the community, recruit students and generate new project ideas.
