# Introduction

The overall goal of this module is for us to begin building awareness of our own identities and those of others in the context of systemic patterns of power, privilege and marginalization. As our awareness grows we can begin altering our own behaviors to continue fostering psychological safety in group settings. 

After completing this module, hackweek supporters will:

* understand the importance of psychological safety to support creativity and open science
* have practical experience applying tools that support a healthy learning culture
* identify specific ways we can maximize for inclusivity within existing hackweek structures
