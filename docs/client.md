# General Requirements

Designing and delivering a hackweek can be a significant undertaking! Here are some initial considerations when preparing your event: 

## Location 

Hackweeks require spaces for open interaction and collaboration. Other considerations include  accessibility, providing resources for child care and having flexibile scheduling (especially for virtual work). We have supported a variety of venues in the past and can work with you to find the best option.

### In Person

We look for spaces that offer fast internet connections, opportunities for random interactions during informal sessions, and interactive exchanges during tutorials and projects.

### Virtual 

We use a variety of platforms including Zoom, wonder.me, Slack and JupyterHub to create accessible and interactive virtual spaces.

### Hybrid of In-person and Virtual

We are just beginning to explore the combination of virtual and in person spaces.

## Organizing Team

Every hackweek involves the assembly of a planning team to prepare content and design how the event will be conducted. We will initially work with you to build a small (3-5 person) core team who initiate the defining of hackweek goals, timing and duration. This team will then build out a larger group that designs tutorials and conducts the event. Visit our [roles and responsibilities](services/index) page to learn more details about the composition of a planning team.

## Scheduling and Time Commitment

Planning for a hackweek generally begins 6 months in advance of a virtual event and 12-18 months in advance forin person events.
