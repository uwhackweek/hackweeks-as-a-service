# Resources for Organizing a Hackweek


Hackweeks are participant-driven events that strive to create welcoming spaces for participants to learn new things, build community and gain hands-on experience with collaboration and team science {cite:p}`Huppenkothen2018`

This website provides reference material and training modules to support organizers of earth science themed hackweeks hosted in partnership with The University of Washington's [eScience Institute](https://escience.washington.edu/using-data-science/hackweeks/)
