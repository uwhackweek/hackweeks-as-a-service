the activities undertaken by the organizer team to conceptualize and deliver the hackweek
program.

--------

## Community Lead
The Community Lead guides the activities of community members engaged in hackweek
organization and execution. This is typically the person who contacted eScience
requesting a hackweek.

### Goals
- Matching the technical and scientific needs of the community to the design of the
hackweek.
- Ensuring everyone involved is sufficiently resourced to carry out the work.
- Strategizing on how best to implement practices of open-source science within this
community.
- Building supportive partnerships and communities of practice before, during, and after
the hackweek.

### Specific Activities
- Acquire funding to support hackweek activities.
- Work with the community to define the overarching goals of the hackweek.
- Build a diverse, inclusive, and equitable hackweek organizing team; recruit broadly for

community relevance.
- Attend the hackweek and be available to assist with project and tutorial work.
- Facilitate and/or lead longer-term community efforts to build on collaborations
fostered around the hackweek.

## Tutorial Lead
Tutorial Leads use their knowledge of data science tools and methods to create online
learning materials and teach tutorials during the hackweek.

### Goals
- Fostering the learning and development of community members on topics of interest at
the hackweek.
- Supporting the design of a shared open source curriculum.

## Specific Activities

## Technical Helper
Technical Helpers have knowledge of data or domain science tools and methods that they
wish to share with their peers. Helpers can include eScience staff, community members and
hackweek participants.

### Goals
- Helping hackweek participants move past stuck points and complete learning objectives.
- Including all participants in the learning process.
- Empowering learners to connect with external educational resources.

### Specific Activities
- Answer questions from participants during the teaching of tutorials.
- Help participants access resources needed to address specific problems.

## Project Consultant
The Project Consultant has a big-picture view of the possible scope of projects for the
hackweek community, and helps participants get clear on project ideas and objectives.

### Goals
- Communicating the purpose and approach of small group collaborations.
- Shaping community ideas into well-defined and realistic project designs.
- Creating a welcoming space for participants to engage in project ideation and
completion.

### Specific Activities
- Post information on Slack to participants about the structure and purpose of hackweek
projects.
- Encourage participants to pitch project ideas before the hackweek.
- Assemble and make sense of project ideas.
- Guide the formation of project teams on the first day of the hackweek.

project goals. Usually the project lead is the person who pitches a project idea.

### Goals
- Supporting all team members in getting something valuable out of their time during
hackweek project work.
- Fostering collaboration within a small team.
- Laying the foundation for long-term project development after the hackweek is complete.

### Specific Activities
- Pitch an idea for a project.
- Gather a team and help each person get clear on their individual goals during the
project work.
- Facilitate relationship-building and development of collaborative structures among
the team.
- Help everyone design project work that is within the scope of the hackweek.
- Lead daily standup team check-ins.
