# Participant Selection

We strive to welcome a diverse cohort of hackweek participants to our events. For our in-person events, we set limits on the total number of participants that depends on the venue size as well as the number of people helping us support the event. We feel it is important to have a low helper to participant ratio so that people can get the individualized attention they need to have questions answered.

Our selection process is continually evolving, and different hackweeks employ different methods. Below we describe the approach adopted for the NASA Earth Sciences 2024 Hackweek.

## NASA Earth Science Hackweek 2024

For this event we follow the approach described by Huppenkothen {cite}`Huppenkothen2020`. The people reviewing applicants include the eScience Hackweek Program Director (Arendt), the eScience Program Manager for Community Engagement (Welden-Smith) and the Community leads of the 3 hackweeks (Joachim Meyer, Jessica Scheick and Nicoleta Cristea).

Selction steps:

* the eScience Program Manager does an initial blind review of every application to remove duplicates or any applications that fit poorly with our broad program objectives (for example, someone only interested in acquiring software skills).
* the hiring committee works with this list to pre-select up to 5 people per hackweek (15 total) who are within our networks. This provides an opportunity for us to empower specific people
