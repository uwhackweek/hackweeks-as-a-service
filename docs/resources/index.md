# Resources for Organizers

The eScience Institute supports Community Partners in planning each hackweek. We invite organizers to join a series of planning sessions to prepare for an event. Not everyone is expected to attend every session, and your level of commitment will depend on your chosen role.

## Planning Sessions

We host a series of 8 to 10 weekly planning sessions on zoom during the two months prior to a hackweek. These sessions include:

* a kickoff meeting to build team connections and to get clear on the purpose of the hackweek
* scheduling and logistics planning 
* tutorial ideation and design 
* website creation and publishing of Jupyter Notebooks
* designing structures to support project team work

## Professional Development Opportunities

We recognize that many people will be new to tutorial design and guiding project work. Therefore we offer several opportunities for professional development for hackweek organizing teams. These include training sessions in:

* data science pedagogy
* facilitation approaches to foster teamwork and collaboration
* peer feedback on tutorial delivery
* best practices for creating inclusive and welcoming event spaces

## Funding Support    

Depending on the funding agency and level of bugetary support, some of our events include honoraria to support organizing team member's time. Many events also cover the costs of travel and lodging for organizing team members (for in person events). Contact the organizers of specific events for more details.
