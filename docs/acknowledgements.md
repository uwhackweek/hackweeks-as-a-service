Hackweeks were designed within the [Moore/Sloan Data Science Environment](http://msdse.org/), and borrow ideas from [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). Early design of hackweeks occurred within previous events including [astrohackweek](http://astrohackweek.org) led by Daniela Huppenkothen and Jake VanderPlas and [neurohackademy](https://neurohackademy.org) led by Ariel Rokem. The model was further developed within a series of earth science related hackweeks including[geohackweek](https://geohackweek.github.io), [waterhackweek](https://waterhackweek.github.io), [oceanhackweek](https://oceanhackweek.github.io) and [Cryospheric Sciences with ICESat-2 hackweek](https://icesat-2hackweek.github.io).

Hackweeks have evolved due to generous funding from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan foundation, and a grant from the Washington Research Foundation.
