# Things you will need 

Part of our process in working with your event will be to clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of our support team and those of your local planning team. These are our general expectations of roles that would be covered by your team:

## A planning and coordination team

The local planning team is responsible for recruitment, participant selection and overall decisions about hackweek scheduling and design. 

## Interactive learning spaces for in-person events

For hackweeks offered entirely or partially in-person, the local team is responsible for reserving an active learning classroom that has technology tools to support interactive learning.

## People to Design and Deliver Tutorials

If your hackweek includes tutorials your role will be to find individuals to teach tutorials and decide what specific topics will be covered. Our team can connect you with resources for finding tutorial support through organizations such as [Software Carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/) or [Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/).
